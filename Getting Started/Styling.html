        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting 
        industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever
         since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled 
         it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, 
         but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. 
         It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
          Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like
           Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

    <!--
    INLINE STYLING - We add the styling directly on the html element with a style attribute.

    INTERNAL STYLING - We add the styling inside <style> tags as part of the html document.

    EXTERNAL STYLING - We add the styling as part of an external css document and use a html <link>
    element to import the .css file. This is likely the best option in many cases since it 
    allows us to group our CSS all in one location.
