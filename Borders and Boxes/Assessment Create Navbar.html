<!-- ASSESSMENT - CREATE A NAVBAR

    The objective here is to create a simple navbar using CSS. The elements
    with the class of "right" should appear to the right hand side of the
    navbar. 

    Feel free to add some additional styling to the nav bar so that it is
    not only functional but looks like something that might be used as
    part of a production web page. 

    Use what you have learned so far in the course and feel free to check out
    the rest of the 'Create Navbar' video if you get stuck.
