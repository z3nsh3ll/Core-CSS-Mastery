<!--

    The objective here is to style the login box so that it appears both
    vertically and horizontally centered.

    This is easy if you know how but can cause developers headaches if
    they don't yet understand how CSS works. 

    Once the login box is centered, feel free to add some additional styling
    so that the login box looks like something we might actually use on a 
    production website.

    If you get stuck, feel free to check out the rest of the 'Assessment - Login'
    video for a solution.
