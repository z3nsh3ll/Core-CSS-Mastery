<!-- BOX MODEL WITH CSS

Firstly, every element has content, padding, border and margin, in that order. Combined, these will
determine the overall space an element takes up.

"Box model" also refers to the 3 main different types of display that can be set on html elements.

1. Block - Elements have height and width but always take up an entire row in the viewport. Other
elements will always be pushed to the next line, regardless of a block element's width.

2. Inline - Elements won't take width and heigh properties and only take up the space of their
content. Inline elements will appear next to other inline and inline-block elements on the
same row provided there is space. 

3. Inline-Block - These are a hybrid option. They mostly behave like Inline elements but
it's now possible to style their width and height (as in the case of block elements).

In html a <div> is a block level element by default while a <span> is an inline element.
Although they accomplish similar purposes they behave very differently as a result. It's possible to 
make a <div> behave like a <span> (and vice versa) by changing the display property on these elements.
