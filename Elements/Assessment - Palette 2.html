        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting 
        industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever
         since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled 
         it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, 
         but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. 
         It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
          Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like
           Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

<!--

This is the same color/theme palette as previous with a few more elements
that we can style.

It likely makes sense to build off your previous color themes and simply
style the new elements.

Why not extract your previous CSS rules into an external stylesheet
and use them with this new html palette to avoid re-writing
previous styles?
