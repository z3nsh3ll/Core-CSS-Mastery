    <p class="paragraph">
        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting 
        industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever
         since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled 
         it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, 
         but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. 
         It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
          Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like
           Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

<!-- BOX SHADOWS WITH CSS

box-shadow [inset, offset-x, offset-y, blur-radius, spread-radius, color]

inset -> Sets the shadow inside the box.
offset-x -> Location and size the shadow horizontally.
offset-y -> Location and size of the shadow vertically.
blur-radius - The larger the value, the bigger the blur effect on the shadow.
spread-radius - The size of the shadow itself
color - Any CSS color

text-shadow - Extremely similar to box shadow but for text
